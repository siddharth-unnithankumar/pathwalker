In order to run the tests in this folder, first activate the `pathwalker` virtual environment (instructions to create this are [here](https://github.com/xesaad/pathwalker/blob/asaad_modifications_2/README.md)) by running
```bash
source <your_path_here>/bin/activate
```
Then, to run a test file (e.g. `test_movement_mechanisms.py`) just run
```bash
pytest test_movement_mechanisms.py
```
